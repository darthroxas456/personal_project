		//5 degrees whenever the left arrow is pressed.
}

if(keyboard_check(vk_right)){

		// this makes the ship rotate to the right 
		//5 degrees whenever the right arrow is pressed.
}

if(keyboard_check(vk_up)){
	motion_add(image_angle, .05);
	// this makes the ship move forward 
	//by .05 frames a second when pressing the up arrow. 
}

	motion_add(image_angle, -.05);
	// this makes the ship move backwards 
	//by .05 frames a second when pressing the down arrow.
}

// this makes the ship teleport from one side of the
//screen to the other when going off the screen.
